# auto_wifi_mode_station_or_ap_with_web_server
Code for work on ESP32 with Arduino framework. 

This repository contains code to enable WiFi on ESP32 devices. If no saved connection data exists, it starts as a WiFi Access Point (AP) and opens a web server to input SSID and password. After saving the data, it restarts and connects to WiFi in station (STATION) mode using the saved information. A practical, flexible solution for easily configuring WiFi connectivity on ESP32 devices.
